# TM Buddy - https://tmbuddy.net

# How it works

:crystal_ball: This app accepts an excel file of unsorted data and coverts it to JSON format to be organized and displayed in the app's interface. TM Buddy then allows for a team manager to interaction with the 'Team Dashboard' which runs automated tasks based off the excel JSON data.

:clipboard: Data will be persisted through the app using Redux and with backend integration via MongoDB.
